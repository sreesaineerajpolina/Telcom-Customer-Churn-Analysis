# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis Using Power BI

Unlock actionable insights and improve customer retention with this Power BI project. By analyzing and visualizing key risk factors, we can proactively prevent customer churn and enhance decision-making.

## 📊 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry. This project leverages Power BI Desktop and Excel to analyze customer behavior, uncover churn risk factors, and provide data-driven insights to reduce customer loss.

## Key Objectives

✔ Predictive Churn Modeling: Identify customers likely to leave, enabling timely interventions.

✔ Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on shared characteristics to create targeted engagement strategies.

✔ Actionable Insights: Uncover trends and patterns that influence churn to drive better business decisions.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis

### 1. Overall Churn Rate

🌟 The customer churn rate is 27%, meaning that out of 7,043 customers, 1,869 left the company.


### 2. Contract & Tenure Impact on Churn

📌 Customers with monthly contracts and shorter tenure are more likely to churn.

📌 Long-term contracts (one-year or two-year) reduce churn risk significantly.


### 3. Customer Demographics & Churn Behavior

📌 Customers without dependents or partners are more prone to churn than those with family commitments.

📌 Gender does not significantly impact churn, but senior citizens are less likely to leave than younger customers.


### 4. Internet Service & Payment Preferences
   
📌 Customers using Fiber Optic internet have a higher churn rate than those on DSL or other services.

📌 The payment method affects churn—customers paying via Electronic Check are more likely to leave compared to those using credit cards or auto-payments.


### 5. Impact of Additional Services
    
📌 Customers without add-on services like Tech Support, Device Protection, and Online Security are more dissatisfied and more likely to churn.

📌 Offering bundled services or incentives could improve retention.
